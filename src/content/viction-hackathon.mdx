# Captains Log | BuzzKill: Honeycomb Hustle

Embarking on our first hackathon journey was an exhilarating experience, akin to navigating uncharted space. 
The Viction Blockchain Hackathon was a challenging mission, and we emerged victorious in the Gaming Track with our project.
<br></br>

BuzzKill is an NFT-based play-to-earn (P2E) game where players stake unique bee NFTs in various hives to earn ERC20 honey tokens. 
The game is set on the planet Nectera, where players navigate through different terrains such as fire-volcano, ice, ocean, forest, and river. 
Each terrain hosts several hives, adding a strategic layer to the game. <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/ea6aead1edf24aa3b89d52498c0a9212" style={{ color: 'orange', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>View the video demonstration here</a>

## Core Mechanics

**Bee NFTs and Staking**:
    - Players mint and stake bee NFTs in different hives. The longer a bee is staked, the more honey tokens it accrues. Each hive has unique characteristics that influence token generation, providing both temporal and spatial earning mechanisms
<br></br>

**Hive Characteristics**: 
    - Hives are influenced by the number of bees staked and their unique traits. More bees in a hive mean more tokens earned by each staked NFT. Hives without queens miss out on lucrative Hive Collective $HONEY.
<br></br>

**Resource Foraging**:
    - Players can forage for resources such as nectar, pollen, and sap in different terrains. These resources are essential for upgrading skills, maintaining bee energy, and conducting raids.
<br></br>

**Raiding and Defense**: 
    - Bees can raid rival hives to steal honey, adding an element of PvP interaction. Hive defense is crucial to protect against these raids, with skills and structures enhancing defensive capabilities.
<br></br>

**Terrain Maps**
- Hives can be located in a variety of different terrains such as fire, ice, ocean, forest, river and desert

## Gameplay Elements
<br></br>

**Hustle for $HONEY**
- Players can choose their $honey-making style, whether through passive gains, macroeconomic strategies, or thrilling raids. Each bee has a daily energy limit, requiring strategic planning for maximum efficiency.
- *Hive Collective $HONEY*: Each hive has a collective pool of $honey. The more industrious the bees, the larger the share each bee receives. Players must guard their pool against raids.
- ***NFT Yields***: Bees earn $honey based on their level. Upgrading skills and gaining XP enhance earnings. Players must maintain nectar levels to continue claiming rewards.
<br></br>

**Raiding and Foraging**
- Raiding allows bees to attack rival hives for $honey. Success depends on the bee's attack skills versus the hive's defense. Foraging is essential for gathering resources like nectar, pollen, and sap. These resources are vital for upgrades and maintaining hive productivity.
<br></br>

**Skill Tree & Upgrades**
- Each bee has a skill tree secured on the blockchain, featuring traits that can be upgraded. Skills include daily energy, loot mastery, regal defense, and natureâ€™s bounty. Upgrades require pollen and XP, demanding strategic resource management.
<br></br>

**Hives and Hive Management**
- Hives can host up to 3 Queens and 55 Workers. Hive skills include defense, stealth, intelligence, and abundance. Constructing buildings like Sentry Towers, Barracks, and Universities enhances these skills, ensuring hive prosperity and protection.
